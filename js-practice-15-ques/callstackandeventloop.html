<!-- Step-by-Step Explanation
1.Call Stack (Synchronous Code):

When the button is clicked:

runExample() is pushed onto the Call Stack

console.log("Start") runs immediately
✔ Output: Start

setTimeout(...) is encountered

The callback is sent to the Web APIs

The timer starts (even with 0ms)

console.log("End") runs immediately
✔ Output: End

runExample() finishes and is removed from the Call Stack
At this point, the Call Stack is empty 


2.Web APIs → Callback Queue:

After the timer completes:

The setTimeout callback (console.log("Async Task")) is placed into the Callback Queue

3.Event Loop:

The Event Loop constantly checks:

❓ Is the Call Stack empty? → Yes

❓ Is there something in the Callback Queue? → Yes

➡ The Event Loop moves the callback from the Callback Queue to the Call Stack

4.Callback Executes:

console.log("Async Task") runs
✔ Output: Async Task

Callback is removed from the Call Stack-->
